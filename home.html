		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Reece, I was born in Waterloo, IA. I grew up in 
			Waverly, IA and graduated from Waverly-Shell Rock High School. 
			Since then, I have lived in Cedar Falls, IA, pursuing a 
			Bachelor's Degree in Communication.</p>
			<p>In my 21 years, I've experienced many different hobbies and 
			interests. Some of my favorite include soccer, juggling, traveling, 
			yoga, and painting. On top of these hobbies, I also enjoy learning 
			in general, so I can just be educated and good at whatever I do in 
			the future.</p>

		<h1>About My Family</h1>
			<p>In total, I have one biological brother, Seth (23), two half brothers,
			Trey (15) and Tysen (15), and pretty recently, four new step siblings. 
			My family recently got much bigger since my mom just remmarried to my 
			new step dad, Steve. However, we all like them a lot and appreciate everything 
			they do.</p>
			<p>My family is probably the most chill and relaxed family you will come 
			across. I say this because what we do for fun is mainly just spending time 
			drinking, playing cards, and whatever we can to all be together. Normally, 
			for any special occassions we tend to just meeet at my mom's house, eat 
			lots of good food, and do lots of group activities.</p>

		<h1>About My School</h1>
			<p>I am a Junior at the <a href="http://www.uni.edu">University of Northern Iowa</a></p>
		<h4>Studies</h4>
			<p>At UNI, I'm studying communication and marketing. I plan on recieving 
			my Bachelor in communication with a minor in marketing in May 2021. After 
			graduation, I plan on going back to graduate school to continue my education
			in either communication studies or in a business field.</p>
		<h4>Fun</h4>
			<p>For fun at school, I spend a majority of my time hanging out with my eight 
			roommates. We somehow found a duplex that we could rent out both sides of and 
			since then I've been living with all eight of my closest friends. What we like 
			to do for fun includes things like playing pool, watching movies, driking too much, 
			making food, etc.</p>
